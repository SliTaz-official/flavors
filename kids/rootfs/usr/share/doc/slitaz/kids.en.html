<h2>SliTaz for kids :-)</h2>

<p>
	Welcome to the SliTaz Kids flavor. This version of SliTaz provides
	an easy to use intuitive desktop for kids older than 5 years. This
	is the first version, any feedback and requests can be done on the
	<a href="http://forum.slitaz.org/">SliTaz Forum</a>.
</p>
<p>
	It lets your child play educational games, listen to music, write text
	documents and view or create images. The desktop uses the Openbox window
	manager, wbar for the icons bar and Nitrogen to set background images.
	The child can also manage his/her files with SpaceFM, which is a
	standard and simple file manager.
</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Games: Childsplay</li>
	<li>Math: Tuxmath</li>
	<li>Music: Alsaplayer</li>
	<li>Write: Xournal</li>
	<li>Paint: MtPaint</li>
	<li>Images: GQview</li>
</ul>

<p>
	As on a standard SliTaz system you can install some more applications
	with the packages manager Tazpkg. Allowed applications for the child
	are on the icons bar and can also be in the Openbox menu, this lets
	the admin choose which applications are available or not.
</p>

<h2>Desktop</h2>

<p>
	The system boots to a standard desktop (floating windows,
	task bar) with some large and accessible icons but no menu and
	no files on the desktop. Any mouse click will popup a small menu
	with shortcuts to applications, an item to start a slideshow with
	all images in ~/Images, an admin menu as well as a logout and
	shutdown item.
</p>
<p>
	If you want a task bar with a clock and notification support, you
	can start tint2 from the command line to try it and add it to an Openbox
	start script to get it run on each session.
</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>
	The defaut icons bar has an icon to play music with alsaplayer,
	which when opened the child must click on the play button to start. The
	playlist is simply all the sound files found in ~/Music, so you
	just have to drop songs in to this folder to add some songs for a child.
</p>

<h2>Childsplay alphabet in your language</h2>

<p>
	Childsplay can use voices from Gcompris for the alphabet. We may
	have support out-of-the-box for some languages in future
	versions. For now you must install the appropriate Gcompris voices
	package and create a symlink, example for French localisation:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg -i gcompris-voices-fr
# ln -s /usr/share/gcompris/boards/voices/fr/alphabet \
	/usr/share/sp_alphabetsounds/fr
</pre>
