<h2>SliTaz for kids :-)</h2>

<p>
	Welcome to the SliTaz Kids flavor. This version of SliTaz provide a
	an easy to use an intuitive desktop for kids older than 5 years. This
	is the first version, any feedback and wisheses can be done on the
	<a href="http://forum.slitaz.org/">SliTaz Forum</a>
</p>
<p>
	It let the child play educational games, listen to music, write text
	documents and view or create images. The desktop use Openbox window
	manager, wbar for the icons bar and Nitrogen to set background
	images. The child can also manage is files with PCmanFM, wich is a
	standard and simple file manager.
</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Games: Childsplay</li>
	<li>Math: Tuxmath</li>
	<li>Music: Alsaplayer</li>
	<li>Write: Xournal</li>
	<li>Paint: MtPaint</li>
	<li>Images: GQview</li>
</ul>

<p>
	As on a standard SliTaz system you can install some more applications
	with the packages manager Tazpkg. Allowed applications for the child
	are on the icons bar and can also be in the Openbox menu, this let
	the admin choose wich applications are avalaible or not.
</p>

<h2>Desktop</h2>

<p>
	The desktop introduce to a standard desktop (floating windows, 
	tasks bar) with some large and accessible icons but no menu and
	no files on the desktop). Any mouse click wil popup a small menu
	with shortcuts to applications, an item to start a slideshow with
	all images in ~/Images, an admin menu as well as a logout and
	shutdow item.
</p>
<p>
	If you want a task bar with a clock and notifycation support, you
	can start tint2 from command line to try it and add it to Openbox
	start script to get it run on each session.
</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>
	The defaut icons bar have an icon to play music with alsaplayer,
	when opened the child must click on the play button to start. The
	playlist is simply all the sound files found in ~/Music, so you
	just have to drop songs in this folder to add some songs for childs.
</p>

<h2>Childsplay alphabet in your language</h2>

<p>
	Childsplay can use voices from Gcompris for the alphabet. We may 
	have support for out-out-the-box for some languages in future
	version. For now you must install the appropriate Gcompris voices
	package and create a symlink, exemple for French localisation:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg -i gcompris-voices-fr
# ln -s /usr/share/gcompris/boards/voices/fr/alphabet \
	/usr/share/sp_alphabetsounds/fr
</pre>
