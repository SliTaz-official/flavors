<h2><font color="#DF8F06">Getting started</font></h2>

<a name="network"></a>
<h3>Network connections</h3>
<p>
Click on the "Network Status Monitor" at the bottom right of the screen, 
"Configure" and then the network manager (netbox) will come up. You can 
go to the "DHCP" tab and click "Start", and Slitaz will send a DHCP request 
to the local router. You may also setup a static IP, PPPoE, PPP, VPN and 
more using their respective tabs. To configure a wireless connection you 
can use SliTaz wifibox by clicking "Wireless Manager" in the Network Manager 
or by using the "System Tools" menu entry -> "Wireless networks connections".
</p>
<p>
More detailed information can be found in the Handbook: 
<a href="http://www.slitaz.org/en/doc/handbook/network-config.html"
	>Network configuration</a>
</p>

<a name="apps"></a>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>
To have a list of all graphical applications you can use the SliTaz menu button 
at the bottom left of the screen. To have a list of command line tools, you
can open a terminal and double press on the tabulation button. And to have
a list of all installed packages you can use the package manager user interface
using the panel icon or from the "System Tools" menu. To install any new packages
you must have a network connection, the DVD of packages or an USB storage device 
with downloaded packages from another machine. Naturally any package management
can also be done from the command line and <code>tazpkg</code>.
</p>

<a name="office"></a>
<h3>Office suite</h3>
<p>
The SliTaz packages database provides some lightweight office applications.
All of these packages are easily installable in a few clicks through the packages
manager. SliTaz also provides a simple way to install the famous and powerful
OpenOffice suite: just search OpenOffice in the packages manager, double click
on "get-OpenOffice3" and install the script with the <code>Auto exec</code> option
enabled. 
</p>
<p>
To have a lightweight office suite; use: Abiword as Word processor, Gnumeric as 
Spreadsheet and Homebank for Bank Accounting.
</p>

<a name="multimedia"></a>
<h3>Multimedia</h3>
<p>
Most SliTaz flavors include a wide range of sound card drivers, a volume
mixer and a light audio player to easily listen to any MP3 or OGG files. The Sound
card is autodetected at boot time and audio support works out-of-the-box
on many systems. If you manually add a new user and can't listen to audio, please
check that the user belongs to the <code>audio</code> group. For any other trouble please
look into the full documentation and use the forum for more help.
</p>
<p>
Videos can be watched by installing one single package or using a dedicated
LiveCD or LiveUSB system. The SliTaz team have packaged some of the best video players 
available under GNU/Linux: <code>mplayer</code>, <code>xine-ui</code> and <code>vlc</code>
</p>

<a name="info"></a>
<h3>System information</h3>
<p>
You can get information on your system by clicking on "System information"
in the System Tools menu, then "Summary". Clicking on the other 
options on the side brings you more information, and using the benchmarks
gives you an idea on how fast your computer is. To have a list and control
of all your current processes you can use the "Task Manager".
</p>

<a name="root"></a>
<h3>Becoming Root</h3>
<p>
By default, Slitaz doesn't have its desktop running as root administrator:
it asks for a root password (default <code>root</code>) for any dangerous work.
Therefore, it is safer and more secure. To become root in an xterm, simply 
type <code>su</code>, and enter the root password.
</p>

<a name="install"></a>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
SliTaz can be installed to a hard disk or on an USB mass storage device using the
"SliTaz Installer" from the "System Tools" menu. The installer makes a full HD install.
SliTaz won't work in memory (RAM) anymore like in Live or Frugal mode and 
everything is persistent.
</p>
<p>
To generate a LiveUSB system you can use "Tazusb LiveUSB Tool" from the "System Tools"
menu or <code>tazusb</code> from the command line. More information can be found in the SliTaz
Handbook: <a href="http://www.slitaz.org/en/doc/handbook/liveusb.html">LiveUSB media</a>
