# /etc/rcS.conf - Initial boot script configuration for SliTaz GNU/Linux.

# Use udev to populate /dev and handle hotplug events.
UDEV="yes"

# Clean up the system removing all tmp and pid files.
CLEAN_UP_SYSTEM="yes"

# Filesystems to check integrity of at boot time. You should check the
# rootfs (where SliTaz is installed) and all partitions listed in
# /etc/fstab. Example: CHECK_FS="/dev/hda5 /dev/hdb1"
CHECK_FS=""

# Fast boot into X by setting the system keymap-locale and starting
# the Slim login manager earlier at boot time. If fast X is enabled
# then dbus, hald and slim can be removed from RUN_DAEMONS.
FAST_BOOT_X="no"

# Graphical boot with fbsplash (To easily configure use: tazfbsplash)
FBSPLASH="no"

# Start Kernel log daemons (syslogd and klogd).
KERNEL_LOG_DAEMONS="yes"

# available.

# Automaticaly recharge packages list on each boot and in background.
# If new packages or upgrade are avalaible they will be notified with

RECHARGE_PACKAGES_LIST="no"

# Initialization scripts to run at boot time. Boot order is important:
# bootopts.sh (boot options) must start first, hwconf.sh after network.sh (tazx
# needs an active connection to install Xorg), then you are free to choose.
# Note that the local.sh script exists to let you quickly add some local startup
# commands.
RUN_SCRIPTS="bootopts.sh network.sh i18n.sh hwconf.sh local.sh"

# Daemons to start at boot time. SliTaz only provides a few daemons: firewall,
# Web server (lighttpd), SSH server (dropbear) and rsyncd, so boot order is
# not really important, but dbus/hald should be started before slim.
RUN_DAEMONS="dbus hald firewall slim tazpanel"

# Pre login bold message.
