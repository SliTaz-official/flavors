I removed Gparted/LostIRC; so all *mm packages can be removed saving lots
of space on the ISO (~2Mb). Tazinst can handle partitions on its own no ?

Proposed packages removed from 4.0
-----------------------------------

-ntfs-3g
-ntfsprogs
-gparted
-lostirc
-pangomm
-glibmm
-gtkmm

Really not sure about these ones either:

-transmission
-isomaster
-lua
-hardinfo

Only for the 'man command' ? Why not install it on the fly since man is
not often used ?

-readline
-retawq
